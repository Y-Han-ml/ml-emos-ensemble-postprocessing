## Results Summary

This folder summarizeds main results from the ML-EMOS postprocessing experiments.

### Main Outcomes

- Consistent improvement in forecast performance over rall ensemble rainfall forecasts
- Typical overall and extreme events performance gains of approximately 10-20% in terms of CRPSS and BSS
- However, the forecast reliability show limited improvement indicated by rank histograms

### Interpretation

The improvement in CRPSS and BSS shows that implementing ML-EMOS and using weather regimes helps the model correct systematic bias and produce better forecasts.
However, the rank histograms suggest a issue: the model struggles to properly calibrate the ensemble spread to make model more reliable.
