## Results Summary

This folder summarizeds main results from the ML-EMOS postprocessing experiments.

### Main Outcomes

- Consistent improvement in forecast performance over rall ensemble rainfall forecasts
- Typical overall and extreme events performance gains of approximately 10-20% in terms of CRPSS and BSS
- However, the forecast reliability show limited improvement indicated by rank histograms

### Interpretation

The 10–20% improvement in CRPSS and BSS shows that using weather regimes as a physical constraint helps the MLP correct systematic bias and produce sharper forecasts. 
However, the rank histograms point to a remaining issue: the model still struggles to properly calibrate the ensemble spread to make models more reliable.
